# helloworldmini
A repository of simple, bite sized implementations that I have adapted either from what I have learnt in school or from various interesting literature reviews. Codes and experiments are from learning and exploring machine learning for personal curiosity, where I found it useful to personally try certain implementations so I can better digest ! 

I personally do not think these implementations are big enough to be considered projects, hence the repository name.
